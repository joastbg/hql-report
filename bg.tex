\chapter{Background}

A financial security is a tradable legal claim on a firm's asset or income 
that is traded in an organized market\cite{alexander2008market}.
A portfolio is  a number of positions in such securities, equities, bonds
and other types of financial instruments. 
Such instruments are typically traded on an exchange such as 
\href{http://www.nasdaqomxnordic.com/}{NASDAQ OMX Nordice}, but so-called
\emph{over-the-counter} (OTC) products also exist where two parties enter
a unilateral, legally binding, trade.\\

The value of such a collection can be computed to reflect the theoretical 
value they would have if they existed today. This allows investors to assess
whether resources could yield higher returns elsewhere.\\

Such analyses involve an understanding of the industries, economics, mathematics
and computer science. For instance, domain-specific knowledge in the energy 
industry is a prerequisite for fruitful investing in oil. Similarly, economists 
must apply their knowledge to best assess market trends and constantly reevaluate
the forecasts they base their trading on.
Further, people known as \emph{quants} combine mathematics and computer science
in creating and implementing models for risk management, asset pricing or 
algorithmic trading.\\

In this project we concern ourselves with mathematical finance and the tool
set required by \emph{quants}.\\

Fixed income
Two components are key to the pricing of assets in the fixed income category.

Credit risk is a method of evaluating the creditworthiness of a debitor, i.e. 
quantifying how likely it is that the counterpart will pay back its debt. This 
is not considered for exchange-traded products, as losses caused by defaults 
are covered by the members of the exchange\footnote{If a large exchange 
defaults the world economy would be in utter turmoil.}. However, for OTC
products, the evaluation of credit risk is critical as the consequences of a 
default of the counterparty lies solely with the opposing party. Since the 
financial crisis of 2008 this has become increasingly important for financial 
institutions [ref], and clearing houses have been established to mitigate the 
domino effect of collapses of large financial institutions.
The time value of money and credit risk are two key components allowing 
investors to gauge whether an investment will be in their favour.\\

Financial instruments are priced differently, some using closed-form functions 
and others relying on stochastic simulation, the latter being scoped out of 
this project.\\




Today, all the complexity we describe must be coalesced and manifested by means
of modelling the different financial assets and concepts in a computer program.\\

The time value of money is a concept that allows investors to assess whether an 
investment is up to par. In essence, it tells us how high a return an 
investment should yield as a function of the time the resources are tied up.
Discounting is a method of scaling a future cashflow so as to represent its 
theoretical value it would have had it existed today.
As the prevailing interest rate is observable, the time value of money enables 
the investor to assess whether an investment is up to par. A promise of a 
payment in the future therefore has to be proportional to what the investor 
otherwise would have been able to receive in the market.\\

We now briefly describe the financial products in the category of fixed income, 
and we refer appendix A for a more in-depth treatment.\\

\section{Related work}

In terms of free software, the amount of quantitative finance libraries is 
limited.
The most prominent is Quantlib, an open-source C++ library[ref] supporting a 
wide array of financial products ranging from bonds to more exotic derivatives.\\

Hquantlib[link] is an attempt at a Haskell port of Quantlib and is under 
development.\\

Peyton Jones and Eber [ref] developed a combinator library allowing users to 
define virtually any financial contract by means of a computational 
denotational semantics (this is wrong, reread article + denotational semanctics 
+ Tacking the Awkward Squad + Composing Contract summary/references).\\

Sinan Gabel developed DerivativesExpert[ref], an extension for Mathematica[ref] 
for valuation of financial products such as bonds, interest rate derivatives 
and options. Our project aims to create the core Haskell architecture for 
valuation of such products and re-engineer a subset of DerivativesExpert, 
mainly fixed income securities) into Haskell.
