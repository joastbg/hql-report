\chapter{Introduction}

Our lives becoming increasingly dependent on IT, and as a result, software errors are manifold. The financial sector has a particular low tolerance, as erroneous software may have dire consequences in the form of massive monetary loss.
The financial crisis of 2008 also caused legislators to take a conservative
stance on risk (cite), as the collapse on Lehman Brothers reverberated throughout the world's economies.
Consequently, financial institutions' risk management tools must become more sophisticated, putting stress on the quality of the software.

We present a prototype Haskell library for valuation of financial products.

The project was conducted within the \textsc{Hiperfit} research center at the
University of Copenhagen.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
-- Type annotation (optional)
fib :: Int -> Integer

-- With self-referencing data
fib n = fibs !! n
        where fibs = 0 : scanl (+) 1 fibs
        -- 0,1,1,2,3,5,...

-- Same, coded directly
fib n = fibs !! n
        where fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
              next (a : t@(b:_)) = (a+b) : next t

-- Similar idea, using zipWith
fib n = fibs !! n
        where fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

-- Using a generator function
fib n = fibs (0,1) !! n
        where fibs (a,b) = a : fibs (b,a+b)
